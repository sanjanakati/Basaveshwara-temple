      <h2>Temple Location</h2>
      <p>Basaveshwara Temple is located in Kuntoji Village, Muddebihal Taluk, Vijayapura District, Karnataka.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Historical Significance</h2>
      <p>It is believed that in the 12th century, after the revolutionary movement at Kalyana, Basavanna worshipped at the Sangameshwara temple in Kuntoji while en route to Kudala Sangama. The temple is considered sacred as it lies on a path once walked by Sharanas (devotees), giving it religious significance.</p>

      <p>The temple is surrounded by four directions of devotion: Allisab Dargah in the north, Gangappayya’s temple in the south, Ghanamateshwara in the west, and Mali Basaveshwara in the east. At the center stands Nandi Basavanna of Kuntoji.</p>

      <p>Inscriptions suggest that the temple received donations from Jayasimha Somanatha II and Madhava Simhana of the Kalyana Chalukya dynasty. The temple, built during their reign, is historically significant and believed to have taken 20 years to complete.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Architectural Details</h2>
      <p>The temple includes a sacred well in front from which holy water was drawn to offer worship to Nandi. An inscription carved near the well features the Sun, Moon, Shiva Linga, Nandi, and other deities. This inscription is still visible today.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Annual Jatre Festival</h2>
      <p>The annual Jatre (festival) is celebrated grandly on the last Monday of Shravan (depending on how many Mondays the month has). Traditionally, the Jatre of Kuntoji Basavanna is scheduled not to clash with the Bagewadi Basavanna Jatre. If there are four Mondays in Shravana Masa, Kuntoji Jatre is on the fourth; if five, it's on the fifth.</p>

      <p>The temple committee, formed for temple renovation, organizes and manages the festival. Devotees from various districts of Karnataka as well as from states like Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu visit the temple to offer their prayers.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Facilities & Development</h2>
      <p>Due to increasing pilgrim traffic, accommodation has become insufficient. Hence, based on suggestions from the temple committee and devotees, 13 new rooms with toilets have been added at the Basaveshwara Yatranivas.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Cultural Programs</h2>
      <p>During the Jatre, numerous cultural events are held such as comedy shows, weightlifting competitions, bull cart races, tractor races, dramas, and more. Daily prasada (holy offering) is also distributed to devotees throughout the festival.</p>
